# Smart Farming Using IOT and Plant Disease Name Detection
Dataset Source https://data.mendeley.com/datasets/tywbtsjrjv/1.

Plant Disease Name Detection using Random Forest Classifier and Hist Gradient Boosting Classifier in hardware Raspberry Pi 4B and Sensor data through Sensor Node(Arduino Nano+ NRF24L01+).
Receiver (ESP8266+NRF24L01+) where receiver transmits the data to Blynk Cloud (Local Server created using Raspberry Pi 4B ) and the data is now able to access through Local server.

Outcomes:
Precision Farming,

Automatic Water Irrigation,

Controlling of Pesticides,

By Using NPK sensor, monitoring the required Nutrients for healthy Growth
